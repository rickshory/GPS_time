GPS_time
======
 This project is superseded by **GPS_time_841**.  
Both these are modules of the Greenlogger project.  
 Although **GPS_time** is not complete, it is retained as an example of implementing UARTS in software.  
 Development continues in the project **GPS_time_841**, using the
ATTiny841 microcontroller in place of the ATTiny84.  
 The ATTiny841 has built in UARTS, and is a better overall solution.  
 The ATTiny84, used for initial development, required implementing UARTS in code and serves as an example of how to do this.  
 The overall purpose is to capture serial data from a GPS, extract only the time signal, and pass this on to the main controller, to keep its Real Time Clock current.
